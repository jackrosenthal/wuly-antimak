{"name":"The WULY Antimak","tagline":"Modifier-based keyboard layout inspired by Antibracket, Colemak, and a couple others.","body":"An ergonomic modifier based keyboard layout with Antibracket's symbols and numbers and a home row practically stolen from Colemak. Also focuses around ease of vimming and still optimised for the English language... so basically it's crack for your keyboard.\r\n\r\n![Reference image](https://github.com/jackrosenthal/wuly-antimak/raw/master/reference.png)\r\n\r\nAlso take note how easy it is to type `ls` and `cd`.\r\n\r\n## Installation & Testing\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/jackrosenthal/wuly-antimak && xkbcomp -I$PWD/wuly-antimak/xkb wuly-antimak/xkb/test.xkb $DISPLAY\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/jackrosenthal/wuly-antimak && sudo bash wuly-antimak/linux/install.sh\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nCurrently there is only an AHK script, but you don't need admin rights. Perfect for when you need to\r\nhop on a public computer.\r\n\r\nTo use it, download windows/bin/wuly.exe from this repo and run it. Press both the left and right alt\r\nkeys to exit.\r\n\r\nIf you are using your own computer, you may want to have it run at startup (not sure how to do that.)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
