# Antibracket

This is a keyboard layout designed to combine the ambition of Dvorak, practicality of Colemak and
the punctuation of Neo.

## Testing

There is currently no way to integrate Antibracket into the main XKB repositories. For now, though,
you can run:

    xkbcomp -I$PWD/xkb xkb/test.xkb $DISPLAY
